To do tasks:

1. Add flow end time to CSV.
2. Add active timeout. If active timeout and idle timeout are zero (0), then no timeout, respectively.
3. Add mean/max/min/std IAT of flows
4. Add number of previous timeouts (active or idle) and the time since previous timeout (useful when defining timeouts)

Optional
1. Check how to recognize out-of-order and DUPACK
2. When timing-out a TCP flow due to FYN, how probable a future TCP connection will use the same flow headers (belong to the same timed-out flow)
