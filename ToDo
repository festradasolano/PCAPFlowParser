To do tasks:

 - Add active timeout. If active timeout and idle timeout are zero (0), then no timeout, respectively
 - Add mean/max/min/std IAT of flows
 - Add number of previous timeouts (active or idle) and the time since previous timeout (useful when defining timeouts)

Optional:
 - Check how to recognize out-of-order and DUPACK
 - When timing-out a TCP flow due to FYN, how probable a future TCP connection will use the same flow headers (belong to the same timed-out flow)
