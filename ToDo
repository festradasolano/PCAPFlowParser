To do tasks:

 - Add number of previous timeouts (active or idle) and the time since previous timeout (useful when defining timeouts)
 - Write report file
 - Handle files as input and output paths
 - Add argument options to run the program 

Optional:
 - Check how to recognize out-of-order and DUPACK
 - When timing-out a TCP flow due to FYN, how probable a future TCP connection will use the same flow headers (belong to the same timed-out flow)
